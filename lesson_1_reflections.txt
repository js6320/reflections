How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    since it is just showing the different part of the code, it was easier to see what actually changed so far in the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I don't have to fear that I will break something in the code since I can go back to the previous (successful) version of the code anytime I want even if the new (buggy) version doesn't work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    against Google Docs, Dropbox.
    Cons: can't save changes automatically.
    Pros: working in offline as well, more efficiently save the changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    very useful, especially for web developers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can all the commits have been made so far through git log and compare any two commits among these through git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    since you have saved successful version of the code, you don't have to worry about breaking something and cannot fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    create a good web applicaiton and git will help.
