When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you wnat to share the code with people or when you have a project working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because there are some changes that you don't want to share with anybody and don't feel like upload.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are cloning repositories inside the gitHub : when you want to work wiht someone on the project, you want to pull the files, but also
    you want to let someone make their changes to the file and push it.
    colnes are copying repositories from the gitHub to your local computer : when you just want to start work with the stuff and make your own thing.
    branches are making more commits in local computer : when you want to save all the changes you have made on your local computer. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    when I'm offline, such as taking a plane where wifi doesn't work, I can still work with pretty much up-to-date file changes. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I need to worry more about conflict when I use GitHub, but it will help when I need to collaborate with other people remotely than using Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when I want to want to run some experiment, and when I'm not sure if this work or not, 
I would use other branch than master. If I can do that I can keep going on with master branches work, but still I can run some type of experiment separate from the main work.
